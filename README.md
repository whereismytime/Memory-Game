# Memory Game Project ðŸŽ®

Welcome to my project repository for the Memory Game, created to practice and showcase skills in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and interactive web development.

## ðŸ“– What is this?
This project is an interactive memory game where players try to match pairs of cards. It includes a scoring system, leaderboard, and a challenging mode with added game rules. The goal of the game is to flip pairs of cards and find all the matches, with some surprises in hard mode!

## ðŸŒŸ Key Concepts Covered:
### DOM (Document Object Model):
- Accessing and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Dynamically creating and styling elements on the page.
- Using event listeners to enable interaction with game elements.

### Game Mechanics:
- Implementing a scoring system that tracks player points.
- Leaderboard functionality with data storage using `localStorage`.
- Introducing a hard mode with bombs that deduct points, adding a challenging twist to the game.

## ðŸ’¡ Why this is important?
This project demonstrates essential skills in creating interactive, responsive, and dynamic web applications. By practicing with this memory game, I'm enhancing my ability to:
- Build engaging user experiences with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- Manage game states, such as score and active players, and handle complex game logic.
- Use `localStorage` for persistent data storage, allowing players' scores to be saved even after they close the browser.

## ðŸš€ What am I doing here?
In this repository, I am:
- Learning and practicing how to create a complete game interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implementing game logic for matching cards and scoring, as well as a leaderboard system.
- Experimenting with CSS animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey to deepen my understanding of front-end development. Through this exercise, I'm practicing creating interactive content and improving my problem-solving skills in web development.
